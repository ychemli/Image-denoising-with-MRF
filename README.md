# Image-denoising-with-MRF

This repository contains the implementation of a very short yet powerful algorithme to do energy minimzation. Called ICM for Iterated Conditional Mode, this algorithm is iterative and deterministic. It modifies at each stage the values of all the sites of a graph. 

We're using it here for image denoising, where we consider an image x as the realisation of a random field X.
